# Optimized Triple Ensemble Trading Strategy

## Overview

This repository contains an optimized triple ensemble trading strategy that leverages LSTM, GRU, and Random Forest models to predict stock price movements and execute trades. The strategy incorporates advanced feature engineering, Bayesian optimization, and dynamic portfolio management for enhanced performance.

## Features

*Deep Learning Models*: Bi-directional LSTM and GRU for capturing sequential patterns.

*Machine Learning Model*: Random Forest for feature-based classification.

*Feature Engineering*: Incorporates RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ATR, ADX, and other indicators.

*Ensemble Prediction*: Weighted average of LSTM, GRU, and RF predictions for robust decision-making.

*Bayesian Optimization*: Optimizes buy and sell thresholds for better trading performance.

*Backtesting Module*: Simulates trading strategy performance on historical data.

*Risk Management*: Implements position sizing and dynam
